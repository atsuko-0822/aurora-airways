# ✈️Aurora Airways – Airline Ticket Booking App
**Aurora Airways** is a fictional airline ticket booking website built as part of a team project during a six-month web development bootcamp. The goal was to create a responsive, user-friendly application where users can search, book, and manage flight reservations with ease. As someone who loves traveling, I was especially interested in how airline booking platforms are structured and function.
The name Aurora was inspired by the breathtaking beauty of natural phenomena like the northern lights—capturing the sense of excitement and wonder that comes with planning a trip to a dream destination.
I aimed to reflect this colorful and uplifting mood in the design and user experience of the site.
